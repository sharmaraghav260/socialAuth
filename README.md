# socialAuth
Implement Facebook login using the JavaScript SDK and take a look at the Graph API. I will also work with the Graph API explorer and take a look at the different permissions that we can request with the access token.

# Use
Run [index.html](https://github.com/sharmaraghav260/socialAuth/blob/master/index.html) on a normal server.
